## Task
Write a program that will accept an integer as input. It should then output a message stating whether it's a prime number or not.

## Extension
Time how long it takes to calculate whether specific large numbers are prime or not. Then consider ways to improve the efficiency of your program and time again. Record your findings and report to your teacher.
